### **Project Objective:**
- Apply K-Means Clustering on the Iris dataset to group flowers into distinct clusters based on their sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

### **Dataset Description:**
- The Iris dataset contains data on 150 flowers with the following features:
  - **Sepal Length (cm)**
  - **Sepal Width (cm)**
  - **Petal Length (cm)**
  - **Petal Width (cm)**
- **Species Column**: The dataset also includes a species column, which will not be used during clustering but will be used later for evaluation.

### **Task:**

- **Preprocessing:**
  - Handle missing values (if any).
  - Scale features (if necessary).

- **K-Means Clustering:**
  - Apply K-Means to cluster flowers based on the four features.

- **Determine Optimal Clusters:**
  - Use methods like the **Elbow Method** or **Silhouette Score** to decide on the optimal number of clusters (K).

- **Visualization:**
  - Create scatter plots to visualize the resulting clusters.

- **Comparison:**
  - Compare the resulting clusters with the actual species labels to evaluate the accuracy of the clustering.

### **Expected Outcome:**
- **Cluster Identification**: Identify three distinct clusters that likely correspond to the three species of flowers.
- **Insights**: Gain insights into how well K-Means clustering can separate species based on physical characteristics.
- **Visualization**: Visual representation of how well the clustering algorithm separates the clusters.
